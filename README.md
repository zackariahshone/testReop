# week01homework

First homework assignment for coding boot camp. 

Corrected some HTML errors and ensured all links are working correctly. 

Made all images align to the left side of the page for better viewing/accessability. 

Cleaned up CSS code to be more readable and easier to work with. Also added notes in CSS to explain what many of the segments of code are doing.
